                <h3>Do Not Dispose of Oils in the Sink</h3>
                <p>When the oil mixes with water,<br> 
                it imbalances the water properties and makes it hard for consumption.<br> 
                So, the next time you think of dumping that excess oil,<br> 
                grease or fat into the sink, take a step back and put it in the dustbin instead.</p>

                <h3>Reduce the Usage of Plastics</h3>
                <p>80% of the plastics present in the oceans are from the lands.<br> 
                    This massive amount of plastics getting dumped in the ocean<br>
                     is making our water unfit to drink. Also, it causes severe harm to<br>
                     aquatic life and is the major reason for many sea animals to become extinct.<br>
                    So, if we can reduce the usage of plastics at our home,<br> 
                    we can do a small part in saving the water as well as the aquatic lives.<br> 
                    We can start by reusing the plastic items we have in the home instead of disposing of it.<br> 
                    The next time you’re planning to buy a plastic item, look for similar alternatives<br> 
                    made of wood or any other sustainable material.<br> 
                    Let’s begin today by cutting down the usage of plastic and making our home plastic-free soon.</p>

                <h3>Minimize the Usage of Water</h3>
                <p>Now that we know how precious water is let’s conserve water as much as possible.<br> 
                    Here are a few things we can do:<br>

                    1. Run the dishwasher only when it’s full.<br>
                    2. Use minimum detergent for rinsing.<br>
                    3. Reduce the usage of water per flush by installing a water-efficient toilet.<br>
                    4. Turn off taps when it’s not in use, even if it’s just for a few seconds.</p>

                <h3>Don’t Dispose of Household Chemicals or Drugs with Water</h3>
                <p>We tend to dispose of the old medications and drugs and 
                    household chemicals in the sink or the toilet. 
                    This is again a form of chemical water pollution.
                    Instead, you can approach the local bodies about hazardous 
                    waste collection and dispose of the chemicals properly.    
                    Similarly, the pills and medications should be disposed of with solid waste.</p>

                <h3>Don’t Throw Clothes and Tissues in the Toilet</h3>
                <p>The household items like clothes, dental floss, tissues, wrappers and
                     other papers are usually disposed of in the toilet in many houses. 
                     While it’s okay to flush the toilet paper as it breaks down easily in water, 
                     other such fibrous materials tend to pollute the water and can 
                     stay in the water for a very long time.
                    *Use proper solid waste management practices to dispose of this stuff.</p>
