                <h1>MARINE POLLUTION</h1>
                    <p>The oceans are huge and powerful, 
                    but they are also incredibly vulnerable.
                    We may think of them, and the marine life that inhabits them,
                    as just about infinite, but nothing could be further from the truth. 
                    Humans have made a significant impact on the oceans, 
                    causing everything from coral bleaching to plastic pollution and beyond. 
                    Below, we look at some of the most important conservation issues facing ocean life today,
                    and how some advocates are making a difference.</p>

                    <h2>Overfishing</h2>
                    <p>By far the biggest threat to ocean life is fishing,
                         and the cascade of negative effects that comes with it. 
                         We take a staggering number of fishes from the oceans every year, 
                         by some estimates far more than all species of land animals we kill for food each year combined. 
                         While many people look at the oceans as so vast that their consumption of fishes doesn’t matter, 
                         that is a fallacy that couldn’t be farther from the truth — Faunalytics’ Animal Product Impact Scales are evidence of this. 
                         The global fishing industry is a juggernaut, consumption levels are expected to rise in the coming years, 
                         and each individual consumer of fish contributes to its staggering scale.
                        Unfortunately, it’s not just the fishes that we consume directly who suffer for our appetites.
                        Aside from reducing fish stocks, unsustainable fishing practices can have other negative impacts on the marine environment. 
                        For example, some fishing techniques such as dredging and trawling can cause widespread damage 
                        to marine habitats and organisms living on the sea floor. 
                        These techniques also often capture non-target species (known as bycatch) that are then discarded ,
                        and ghost fishing gear — discarded fishing gear that continues to entangle, trap, and kill fishes for
                         long after it’s been used — mean that there is a vast number of animals that suffer for our food who are not even consumed. 
                         They just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and they never even make it to someone’s plate.

                    <h2>Plastic pollution</h2>
                    <p>Over 300 million tons of plastic are produced every year, 
                    half of which is used in single-use products like cups, bags, and packaging. 
                    At least 8 million tons of plastic enter the oceans every year. 
                    It is impossible to know for sure, but it is estimated that about 150 million 
                    metric tons of plastic exists in our oceans. 
                    Plastic pollution makes up 80% of all marine debris from surface waters to deep-sea sediments.      
                    Larger plastic waste can be ingested by marine species, filling their stomachs and leading them 
                    to believe they are full when in fact they have taken in nothing of nutritional value. 
                    This can bring seabirds, whales, fish, and turtles to die of starvation with plastic-filled stomachs. 
                    Marine species can also be suffocated or entangled in plastic garbage.
                    These microplastics are frequently consumed by marine organisms at the base of the food chain, 
                    like plankton and fish larvae, which leads to a concentration of ingested plastic up the food chain. 
                    Plastics are produced with toxic chemicals, so these toxic substances enter the marine food chain, 
                    including the fish that some humans eat.</p>

                    <h2>Toxic Chemicals</h2>
                    <p>Industrial and agricultural waste is another most common form of wastes
                    that is directly discharged into the oceans, resulting in ocean pollution.
                    The dumping of toxic liquids in the ocean directly affects marine life as 
                    they are considered hazardous, and secondly, they raise the temperature of the ocean, 
                    a phenomenon known as thermal pollution, as the temperature of these liquids is quite high. 
                    Animals and plants that cannot survive at higher temperatures eventually perish.</p>

                    <h2>Oil Spills</h2>
                    <p>Ship pollution is a huge source of ocean pollution, 
                    the most devastating effect of which is oil spills. 
                    Crude oil lasts for years in the sea and is extremely toxic to marine life, 
                    often suffocating marine animals to death once it entraps them. Crude oil is also 
                    extremely difficult to clean up, unfortunately, meaning that when it is split, it is usually there to stay.
                    Besides, many ships lose thousands of crates each year due to storms, emergencies, and accidents. 
                    This causes noise pollution (excessive, unexpected noise that interrupts the balance of life, 
                    most often caused by modes of transportation), excessive algae, and ballast water.
                    Often, other species can also invade an ecosystem and do harm to it by interrupting the life cycles 
                    of other organisms, causing a clash of nature that has already been damaged by the overflow of pollution.</p>

                <p><h2>Ocean Mining</h2>
                Ocean mining in the deep sea is yet another source of ocean pollution. 
                Ocean mining sites drilling for silver, gold, copper, cobalt, and zinc create sulfide 
                deposits up to three and a half thousand meters down into the ocean.
                While we yet to have the gathering of scientific evidence to fully explain the harsh 
                environmental impacts of deep-sea mining, we do have a general idea that deep-sea mining causes 
                damage to the lowest levels of the ocean and increases the toxicity of the region. 
                This permanent damage dealt also causes leaking, corrosion and oil spills that only 
                drastically further hinder the ecosystem of the region.</p>
